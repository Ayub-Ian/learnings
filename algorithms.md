# Understanding algorithms
In order to implement an algorithm in a programming language, you need to understand 
and algorithm down to the details.
- What are the inputs to the problem?
- What is the output?
- What variables should be created and their initial values?
- What intermediate steps should be taken to compute other values and to ultimately compute the output? 
- Do these steps repeat instructions that can be written in simplified form using a loop?

## Linear data structures
 Stacks, queues, deques, and lists are examples of data collections whose items are ordered depending on how they are added or removed.

 Once an item is added, it stays in that position relative to the other elements that came before and came after it. 
 
 Collections such as these are often referred to as linear data structures.

 Linear structures can be thought of as having two ends. Sometimes these ends are referred to as the “left” and the “right” or in some cases the “front” and the “rear.” You could also call them the “top” and the “bottom.” The names given to the ends are not significant. What distinguishes one linear structure from another is the way in which items are added and removed, in particular the location where these additions and removals occur. For example, a structure might allow new items to be added at only one end. Some structures might allow items to be removed from either end.
