# Understanding algorithms
In order to implement an algorithm in a programming language, you need to understand 
and algorithm down to the details.
- What are the inputs to the problem?
- What is the output?
- What variables should be created and their initial values?
- What intermediate steps should be taken to compute other values and to ultimately compute the output? 
- Do these steps repeat instructions that can be written in simplified form using a loop?
