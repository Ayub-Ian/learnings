# Asymptotic Notation
## Introduction
The efficiency of an algorithm is determined by the amount of time, storage and other resources required to execute the algorithm.The effeciency is measured with the help of asymptotic notations.

An algorithm may not have the same performance for different types of inputs. With the increase in the input size, the performance will change.

The study of change in performance of the algorithm with the change in the order of the input size is defined as **_asymptotic analysis_**.

## Definition
**Asymptotic notations** are the mathematical notations used to describe the running time of an algorithm when the input tends towards a particular value or a limiting value.

There are mainly three asymptotic notations:
- [Big-O notation][big0]
- [Omega notation][omega]
- [Theta notation][theta]

### Runtime

- **Definition**: Runtime, or runtime period, refers to the duration during which a program is actively running or executing.
- **Scope**: It encompasses the entire duration of a program's execution, from the moment it starts running until it completes or is terminated.
- **Measurement**: Runtime is often expressed in terms of the overall time duration, from start to finish, including all operations and computations.
- **Usage**: It is a broader concept that includes the dynamic behavior of a program, covering aspects such as resource utilization, error handling, and interactions with the operating system

### Execution Time

- **Definition**: Execution time refers to the total time it takes for a program to complete its tasks or for a specific operation to finish.
- **Scope**: It can refer to the overall time of program execution or the time taken by a specific portion or operation within the program.
- **Measurement**: Execution time is typically measured in units such as seconds, milliseconds, or CPU cycles.
- **Usage**: Developers may use execution time to evaluate the performance of a program, identify bottlenecks, and optimize specific sections of code.
