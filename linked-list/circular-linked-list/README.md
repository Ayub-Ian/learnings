# Circular Linked List
A circular linked list is a type of linked list in which the first and the last nodes are also connected to each other to form a circle.

There are basically two types of circular linked list:
1. Circular Singly Linked List
    - Here, the address of the last node consists of the address of the first node.

2. Circular Doubly Linked List
    - Here, in addition to the last node storing the address of the first node, the first node will also store the address of the last node.

## Why Circular Linked List?
- The starting point can be set to any node.
- Traversal from the first node to the last node is quick.
## Circular Linked List Applications
- It is used in multiplayer games to give a chance to each player to play the game.
- Multiple running applications can be placed in a circular linked list on an operating system. The os keeps on iterating over these applications.
